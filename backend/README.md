## Backend

The SmileSelect backend consists of a number of microservices.

- [**service-registry**]/backend/registry/service-registry/README.md): registry of service instances
- [**appointment-service**](/backend/services/appointment-service/README.md): service handling appointments
- [**auth-service**](/backend/services/auth-service/README.md): service that authenticates users with [JWT Authentication](https://jwt.io/)
- [**dentist-service**](/backend/services/dentist-service/README.md): service handling dentist operations
- [**gateway-service**](/backend/services/gateway-service/README.md): service routing client requests to service instances
- [**logging-service**](/backend/services/logging-service/README.md): service logging errors and events
- [**monitoring-service**](/backend/services/monitoring-service/README.md): service monitoring current stress on the system
- [**notification-service**](/backend/services/notification-service/README.md): service handling email notifications to users
- [**patient-service**](/backend/services/patient-service/README.md): service handling patient operations

### Architecture

<details><summary>Component Diagram</summary>

![Component Diagram](assets/diagrams/component-diagram-milestone4.png)

*This component diagram represents a microservice-based architecture for a distributed dental management system. The system is made up of multiple microservices, a central API Gateway access point, a Service Registry for service discovery, and an MQTT broker for asynchronous communication between services. Some details of the architecture are as follows:*

**User Interfaces:**

The system has two frontends: Patient UI and Dentist UI, which interact with the backend via the API Gateway using RESTful HTTP communication.

**API Gateway:**

Acts as a single entry point for client requests and communication, forwarding user requests to the respective microservices (i.e. Appointment-Service, Dentist-Service).

**Service Registry**

The Service Registry (Eureka Server) is integrated to manage and maintain a dynamic registry of all running microservices. All microservices register themselves at the registry, enabling dynamic service discovery and removing the need for hardcoded endpoints.

**Microservices:**

Each microservice is designed for a specific functionality:

* Appointment-Service: Manages appointments.
* Auth-Service: Handles authentication and authorization.
* Dentist-Service: Manages dentist-related data.
* Logging-Service: Handles logging operations for monitoring of events.
* Monitoring-Service: Monitors all events in the system and provides real-time insight for health and performance.
* Notification-Service: Sends notifications via MQTT.
* Patient-Service: Manages patient-related data.



**Databases**:

Each microservice (except Auth-Service and Monitoring-Service) has dedicated databases to store its data, ensuring modularity and scalability.

**Communication**:

* Synchronous communication (REST) occurs between the API Gateway and microservices.
* Asynchronous communication (MQTT) is used for inter-service messaging, improving decoupling and scalability.

<details><summary>Deployment Diagram</summary>

![Deployment Diagram](assets/diagrams/deployment-diagram-milestone4.png)

This Deployment Diagram represents a distributed system architecture of SmileSelect, detailing the physical deployment of various components and their interactions:

**API Gateway:**

Serves as the central entry point for managing all incoming HTTP requests from the WebClient, routing them to appropriate backend services.

**WebClient:**

Represents the user-facing frontend, hosted on a web server and communicating with the backend via the API Gateway.

**Backend Services:** Includes modular services, each deployed on Spring Boot servers:

* Dental Service, Logging Service, Patient Service, and Notification Service for domain-specific operations.
* Appointment Service deployed with primary and redundant database configurations for fault tolerance.

**Databases:**

Each service has its own dedicated PostgreSQL database (I.e. DentalDB, PatientDB, NotificationDB) for managing application data and data storage.

**MQTT Broker:**

Enables real-time communication using a publish/subscribe mechanism for asynchronous event handling.

**Authentication Service:**

A dedicated service managing user authentication and security.

**Communication:**

* Most interactions between nodes occur over HTTP
* Publish/Subscribe messaging is used inter-service for asynchronous communication.
